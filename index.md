### My name is Prabhav Pande and I am a sophomore at South Brunswick High School. Although I was primarily a programmer, my building skills proved useful towards the team. I was also apart of the drive team as coach because of my strategic capabilities. I am a very enthusiastic learner, passionate programmer and creative thinker. My hobbies lie in basketball, producing music, coding, watching tv shows, playing chess, photography, astronomy and reading fiction books.
